Seascope-ng is a GUI frontend for cscope, idutils and ctags.

Note:
  Seascope-ng was based from Seascope(with revision 254662146ee8). 
I cloned this project due to it's poor support with editing and 
syntax higlighting and lacking of many features.


Plans:

   * use kate for editing and systax high-lighting on linux.
   * add fake-vi to qscintilla and use it as a fall-back to kate.
   * better source browsing like source-insight and slickedit
   * cross-platform support


* Running the application
	cd src
	python Seascope.py

* Generating source distribution package
	python setup.py sdist

* Generating RPM distribution package
	python setup.py bdist_rpm
